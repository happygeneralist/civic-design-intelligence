# ID and link migration

This file defines the safe process for normalising IDs, filenames and internal links in the research repository.

## Purpose

IDs are not just labels. They appear in filenames, YAML frontmatter, wikilinks and relationship fields such as `source_study`, `related_evidence`, `related_needs`, `related_behaviours`, `related_pain_points` and `related_insights`.

Normalising IDs should therefore be treated as a migration, not a casual tidy-up.

## Core rule

Do not rename files or change IDs until the current links and references have been audited.

Use this sequence:

```text
validation baseline -> ID/link audit -> proposed mapping -> review -> migration PR -> validation rerun
```

The validation baseline identifies current structural and governance failures before any migration changes are made.

The ID/link audit then turns those failures into a reviewed mapping and migration plan.

## Relationship to repository validation

Use `tools/validate_repository.py` as the first pass for the audit.

Run:

```bash
python3 tools/validate_repository.py
```

Record the results in:

```text
migration/validation-baseline-report.md
```

The baseline should not be treated as a migration. It is a snapshot of current repository health.

Do not mechanically fix every warning. Classify findings first.

## Canonical ID prefixes

Use these prefixes for structured entity notes.

| Object type | Prefix | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Research study | `RS_` | `RS_001` |
| Evidence | `EVID_` | `EVID_001` |
| User need | `UN_` | `UN_001` |
| Behaviour | `BEH_` | `BEH_001` |
| Pain point | `PP_` | `PP_001` |
| Insight | `INS_` | `INS_001` |
| Theme | `TH_` | `TH_001` |
| Persona | `PER_` | `PER_001` |
| Journey | `JNY_` | `JNY_001` |
| Opportunity | `OPP_` | `OPP_001` |
| Review note | `REV_` | `REV_001` |
| Claim | `CLM_` | `CLM_001` |
| Value dimension | `VAL_` | `VAL_001` |

## What gets a canonical ID

Canonical IDs should be used for structured entity notes, such as evidence, user needs, behaviours, pain points and insights.

Indexes, dashboards, loose notes, anchor summaries and working notes do not need canonical IDs unless they become structured research objects.

## Audit requirements

Before migrating, create an audit table with:

```text
current_path
current_filename
frontmatter_type
frontmatter_id
expected_prefix
proposed_id
proposed_path
source_study
related_evidence
related_needs
related_behaviours
related_pain_points
related_insights
outbound_wikilinks
inbound_wikilinks
validator_findings
risk_level
notes
```

## Finding classification

Classify validation findings before changing files.

| Class | Meaning | Typical action |
|---|---|---|
| Structural error | Breaks schema, IDs, controlled values or lifecycle consistency | Fix in early migration batch |
| Link integrity warning | Broken wikilink or relationship reference | Map before fixing |
| Filename/ID warning | File name does not match canonical ID | Include in ID mapping |
| Ambiguous object | Type, source or canonical status unclear | Human review before migration |
| Acceptable immaturity | Candidate or assumption is incomplete but honestly labelled | Leave as-is for now |

## Risk levels

Use these levels to decide how carefully to review the change.

### Low risk

Use for notes where:

- the current ID already matches the expected prefix
- the filename is consistent
- few or no other notes link to it
- no relationship fields need updating
- validator findings are low-risk or absent

### Medium risk

Use for notes where:

- the ID or filename needs normalising
- there are wikilinks to update
- relationship fields point to an old name
- aliases may be useful during transition
- validator findings indicate missing or inconsistent metadata

### High risk

Use for notes where:

- many notes link to it
- the object type is unclear
- multiple IDs or aliases appear to refer to the same item
- the note may be a duplicate
- the evidence source is ambiguous
- the change could affect validated or reviewed findings
- validator findings suggest lifecycle or evidence-basis overclaiming

## Proposed mapping file

Create a mapping file before making changes.

Suggested location:

```text
migration/id-normalisation-map.csv
```

Suggested columns:

```text
old_path,new_path,old_id,new_id,object_type,old_aliases,links_to_update,validator_findings,risk_level,notes
```

Example:

```csv
old_path,new_path,old_id,new_id,object_type,old_aliases,links_to_update,validator_findings,risk_level,notes
002_Evidence/Quote_001.md,002_Evidence/EVID_001.md,Quote_001,EVID_001,evidence,"Quote_001",true,"invalid ID prefix; unresolved source_study",medium,"Update links from [[Quote_001]] to [[EVID_001]] after confirming source study"
```

## Link update rules

When renaming an object, update:

- filename
- frontmatter `id`
- wikilinks in all Markdown files
- relationship fields such as `source_study` and `related_evidence`
- entry-level changelog if the change is material
- aliases where useful

Use stable ID-prefixed filenames. The preferred pattern is:

```text
UN_001_need_to_match_options.md
EVID_001_signposting_quote.md
RS_001_send_survey.md
```

For user needs, derive the readable slug from `short_name` where possible. Bare ID filenames such as `UN_001.md` are also valid. Avoid filenames where the ID is missing, malformed or different from the frontmatter `id`.

## Aliases

Use aliases during migration when old names are likely to be searched or remembered.

Example:

```yaml
aliases:
  - Quote_001
  - Study_001
```

Aliases should support transition but not become a substitute for canonical IDs.

## Changelog guidance

ID-only migrations usually do not require detailed changelog entries inside every note if no research meaning changes.

Use entry-level changelogs when:

- the object type changes
- the note is split, merged or deprecated
- evidence links change meaningfully
- a source reference is corrected
- a validated or reviewed item is affected

Record the overall migration in `CHANGELOG.md`.

## Validation after migration

After migration, rerun:

```bash
python3 tools/validate_repository.py
```

Check for:

- duplicate IDs
- missing IDs on structured notes
- invalid ID prefixes
- broken wikilinks
- unresolved `source_study` references
- unresolved `related_*` references
- notes whose type and ID prefix do not match
- notes whose filename and ID do not match, where matching is expected

## What not to do

Do not blindly rename every file based on its folder.

Some files may be summaries, indexes, anchor notes, dashboards or working notes rather than structured entity notes.

Do not remove old aliases until the repository has stabilised after migration.

Do not change research claims while performing ID normalisation.

Do not upgrade immature or weakly evidenced objects just to make validation pass.
