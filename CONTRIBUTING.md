# Contributing

This file explains how to add or update material in the research repository.

## Contribution principles

Contributions should be:

- evidence-led
- anonymised
- traceable
- clearly labelled by status
- linked to relevant notes
- reviewed before being treated as validated

The repository may eventually support public, partner and professional contributions as part of a wider civic design intelligence system. These contributions should strengthen the evidence base without directly overwriting the canonical knowledge layer.

## Before adding material

Check whether the repository already contains:

- a relevant research study or evidence source
- similar evidence
- a related user need or civic need
- an existing behaviour, pain point or insight
- a relevant theme or journey stage

Prefer linking and extending existing notes where appropriate. Create new notes when the concept is genuinely distinct.

For the current MVP, follow `docs/Safe_research_ingestion_MVP.md` before breaking research into structured objects.

## External contribution handling

External contributions may come from the public, families, residents, third-sector organisations, advocates, professionals, partner agencies, academic sources, public reports or operational sources.

Treat external contributions as evidence inputs or candidate knowledge, not automatic changes to reviewed or validated objects.

A contribution may:

- support an existing object
- challenge an existing object
- refine wording or scope
- provide contradictory or limiting evidence
- identify a missing need, civic need, behaviour, pain point, risk or insight
- suggest that an object should be superseded
- reveal a sensitivity, safeguarding or privacy issue

Before incorporating an external contribution into a canonical object:

1. Triage the contribution for relevance, safety, sensitivity and identifiability.
2. Check whether it links to an existing object.
3. Preserve the contributor's intended meaning.
4. Record uncertainty, limitations or contradiction.
5. Create candidate objects where needed rather than forcing immature material into reviewed objects.
6. Use an object changelog if the contribution materially changes interpretation, evidence basis, maturity, lifecycle state or value delivery.

Do not use public or partner contributions to mark an object as reviewed or validated unless a human reviewer has explicitly made that judgement.

## File naming

Use stable IDs and readable filenames.

Recommended pattern:

```text
RS_001_send_survey.md
EVID_001_signposting_quote.md
UN_001_match_options_to_needs.md
CN_001_dignified_access_to_pathway_choices.md
BEH_001_discusses_pathway_options.md
PP_001_fragmented_information.md
INS_001_aspiration_changes_with_age.md
```

Avoid untitled files and temporary names in committed work.

## Creating a new note

1. Choose the correct object type.
2. Copy the relevant template from `Templates/`.
3. Assign the next stable ID.
4. Complete required metadata.
5. Add links to related evidence or source material.
6. Set the correct status and review status.
7. Add a changelog entry when required by `docs/Object_change_logs.md`.

## Evidence notes

Evidence notes should preserve the meaning of the source material.

Do not rewrite participant quotes except to anonymise identifying details.

Every evidence note should include, where known:

- source study or source reference
- actor
- context
- journey stage
- evidence kind
- anonymisation status
- confidence
- tags

If the source is unclear, mark this explicitly rather than guessing.

## User needs

User needs should be framed from the actor's perspective and should describe an underlying need, not a solution.

Avoid writing user needs as:

- feature requests
- service requirements
- organisational goals
- policy objectives
- generic aspirations without context

A user need may be drafted from assumptions, but it must be labelled as an assumption until anchored to evidence and reviewed.

## Civic needs

Civic needs should describe what the institution, public service or system must uphold for people, communities or public outcomes.

Use civic needs when the research points to:

- institutional obligations
- public value
- rights, fairness or accountability issues
- access burden
- redressability
- system-level failure or duty
- conditions needed for trust, dignity, agency or equitable service access

During the MVP, civic needs may live in `003_User_needs/` using the `CN_000` ID pattern and `type: civic_need`. A later schema review can decide whether they need a separate folder.

## Insights

Insights should explain why something is happening and why it matters.

A good insight should include:

- a clear claim
- linked evidence
- interpretation
- uncertainty or limitations
- implications for service design, policy or delivery
- emerging user needs or opportunity areas where relevant

## Status changes

Only a human reviewer may promote an item to `validated`.

Do not change status, confidence, analysis state, review status or evidence strength without checking whether an entry-level changelog is required.

## Changelog entries

Every meaningful note should include an entry-level changelog.

Use `docs/Object_change_logs.md` to decide when an object-level changelog entry is required.

The core rule is:

```text
If the change affects how the object should be interpreted, used, trusted or acted on, record it.

If the change only affects formatting, metadata or validation hygiene, rely on Git and the pull request summary.
```

Use this simple format for object creation:

```markdown
## Changelog

- YYYY-MM-DD: Created as candidate user need. Status: assumption. Analysis state: candidate. Evidence basis: none.
```

Use this fuller format for material semantic changes:

```markdown
## Changelog

### YYYY-MM-DD

- Changed:
- Reason:
- Effect:
- Changed by:
```

Repository-wide changes should be recorded in `CHANGELOG.md`.

## Branch workflow

Use a branch for changes whenever possible.

Recommended branch names:

```text
docs/research-repo-governance
schema/normalise-status-fields
research/add-send-survey-evidence
insights/draft-pathway-planning-insights
review/validate-user-needs
```

## Pull request checklist

Before opening a pull request, check:

- [ ] No raw identifiable data has been added.
- [ ] Evidence is anonymised or anonymisation status is explicit.
- [ ] New notes use the schema.
- [ ] Assumptions are labelled.
- [ ] External contributions are triaged before affecting canonical objects.
- [ ] LLM-generated notes are marked.
- [ ] Material changes have changelog entries.
- [ ] Validated content has not been changed without review.
- [ ] Links and IDs are consistent.

## Reviewing a pull request

Reviewers should check:

- whether claims are supported by evidence
- whether evidence strength is appropriate
- whether status values are justified
- whether uncertainty has been retained
- whether any assumptions have been introduced
- whether external contributions have been handled safely
- whether participant or contributor material remains anonymised
- whether the change should be minor, material or major

## LLM-assisted contributions

LLM-assisted contributions must follow `llm-instructions.md`.

LLM-generated content should be treated as draft or assumption until reviewed.
