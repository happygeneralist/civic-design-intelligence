# Civic design intelligence system

This repository is an Obsidian-compatible civic design intelligence system for SEND-related service design, policy and decision-support work.

The current worked example is based on SEND pathway-planning research in Essex. Essex should be treated as the first locale for testing the repository model, not as the boundary of the system. Most needs, pain points, behaviours, insights and civic questions should be captured at the highest useful level, with local context added where it materially affects interpretation, evidence, delivery or decision-making.

It is intended to help researchers, designers, product/service teams and decision-makers capture anonymised evidence, connect it to user needs, civic needs, behaviours, pain points, insights, value dimensions and solution assessments, and maintain a clear audit trail for how research knowledge develops over time.

The repository is not only for designing good services. It should also provide the human intelligence needed to challenge weak, harmful or solution-led decisions with a defensible evidence base.

## Strategic vision

The repository is part of an emerging **civic design intelligence system**: open knowledge infrastructure for public-service needs, evidence, pain and decisions.

It is designed to become a shared, inspectable and contestable knowledge backbone for public services. Over time, it should help public institutions, third-sector organisations, professionals and members of the public contribute to a better shared understanding of what people need, where services cause harm or friction, and where public outcomes remain unsupported.

The repository should separate:

- evidence sources and external contributions
- candidate or submitted knowledge
- reviewed canonical knowledge objects
- decision records and design histories that reference those objects

External insight should strengthen the system without directly overwriting the canonical layer. Contributions from families, residents, third-sector organisations, advocates, professionals, public reports, inspections and academic studies should be treated as valuable evidence inputs that can support, challenge, refine or supersede existing knowledge objects.

## Locales and local context

The system should be able to support localised evidence and decisions without turning every knowledge object into a local-only object.

Use locale metadata when local context changes how an object should be interpreted, for example because of local policy, operational constraints, demographic context, commissioning arrangements, service configuration or evidence source.

Do not localise objects by default. Where a need, pain point, behaviour or insight is likely to apply across places, capture it at the highest useful level and link local evidence to it. Local variants can be created later where evidence shows that the local context materially changes the meaning, risk, priority or response.

## What this repository is for

Use this repository to store and work with:

- research study summaries
- anonymised evidence, quotes, observations and data points
- public, partner or professional contributions after appropriate triage
- academic, sector, Ombudsman, inspection, policy and operational evidence where relevant
- user needs
- civic needs
- behaviours
- pain points
- insights
- themes
- personas
- journeys
- value dimensions
- solution options and assessments
- review notes
- synthesis outputs

The repository should support evidence-based service design, reduce duplicated research, make value visible, and make it easier to understand what is known, what is assumed, what is contested, and what still needs validation.

## What this repository is not for

Do not store:

- raw transcripts
- recordings
- identifiable participant data
- special category personal data that has not been anonymised
- unsupported claims presented as validated findings
- LLM-generated synthesis without clear status and review metadata
- politically preferred solution ideas presented as evidence-backed recommendations

## Repository structure

```text
001_Research_studies/   Research activities and study summaries
002_Evidence/           Anonymised quotes, observations and data points
003_User_needs/         User needs, and civic needs during the MVP phase
004_Behaviours/         Observed or inferred behaviours
005_Pain_point/         Pain points and barriers
006_Insights/           Draft, reviewed and validated insights
007_Themes/             Cross-cutting themes
008_Personas/           Personas or archetypes where appropriate
009_Journeys/           Journey maps and journey-stage analysis
Templates/              Templates for creating structured notes
docs/                   Supporting documentation and governance material
```

## Core principle

Every meaningful claim should be traceable to evidence, or clearly marked as an assumption.

The repository distinguishes between:

- captured evidence
- submitted or candidate knowledge
- draft synthesis
- assumptions
- reviewed analysis
- validated findings
- value dimensions
- solution options and recommendations
- deprecated or superseded material

## Current MVP focus

The immediate MVP is safe ingestion of a small SEND pathway-planning research sample, using Essex as the first locale and worked context.

Use `docs/Safe_research_ingestion_MVP.md` before breaking research into structured objects. It defines the minimum conventions for creating evidence, behaviours, pain points, user needs, civic needs, insights and themes without making immature knowledge look settled.

Use `docs/Object_change_logs.md` when changing existing objects. The core rule is:

```text
If the change affects how the object should be interpreted, used, trusted or acted on, record it.

If the change only affects formatting, metadata or validation hygiene, rely on Git and the pull request summary.
```

## How to use this repository

1. Capture anonymised evidence in `002_Evidence/`.
2. Link evidence to studies, sources, actors, journey stages and tags.
3. Code evidence into user needs, civic needs, behaviours and pain points.
4. Draft insights from linked evidence.
5. Connect needs and insights to value dimensions where useful.
6. Assess solution options against needs, value, evidence, risks and assumptions.
7. Review assumptions, evidence basis and confidence.
8. Promote reviewed work to validated status only when the evidence supports it.
9. Record meaningful object-level changes in entry-level changelogs.
10. Use `CHANGELOG.md` for repository-level changes.

## Working with Obsidian

This repository is designed to work as an Obsidian vault. Use links, backlinks, properties and Dataview queries to navigate between evidence, needs, behaviours, insights, value dimensions and solution assessments.

See `docs/Obsidian_workflow.md` for the recommended workflow.

## Working with LLMs

LLMs may be used to help classify, link, summarise and draft research material, but they must not be treated as evidence.

LLMs must not mark anything as validated, upgrade evidence strength, remove caveats or materially change validated research claims without human review.

See `llm-instructions.md` and `docs/LLM_safety_model.md`.
